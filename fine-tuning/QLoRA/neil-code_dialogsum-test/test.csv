#Person2#: Very much, it's much more fun than being home!
#Person1#: Haha. Well, I suppose we'd better make a start. Shall we get down to business?
#Person2#: Right. First of all can I confirm the time and date of the presentation? It's Saturday 24 October in the morning. What time exactly?
#Person1#: Well, on the invitations we've sent out we've said that the presentation itself will start at 11 and go on till 12:30.
#Person2#: So you'll need the room from about 10 till 2. Would you like us to serve coffee beforehand?
#Person1#: Yes, yes. Oh, and drinks and snacks at the end.
#Person2#: Better to have buffet lunch?
#Person1#: No, I... people who are invited won't be expecting a free lunch. They might think that's overdoing it. They'll want to get back to their families, as it's Saturday.
#Person2#: All right, the normal pre-lunch snack buffet will be what you need--that's basically the same as what you had last February.
#Person1#: Oh, that'll be fine.
#Person2#: OK, well, we'll charge for the room, coffee and snack buffet at the standard rate less 15%, as we agreed. And we'll charge for the drinks served on a pro-rata basis.
#Person1#: Free, fine, yes.
#Person2#: What type of... um.., equipment, furniture would you like?
#Person1#: Well, let's have.., um... four.., no, no... five tables for our display. Er... we'll bring our own stands. Now, there's an overhead projector and sound system already in the room, I believe? Can you get someone to check that before we come, you know, to see that it's working?
#Person2#: Oh, of course, the technician will be with you when you're setting everything up. Oh, the seats in that room have flap-over desk tops, will that be all right?
#Person1#: Yes, yes, that's fine, sure.

#Person2#: Do you have any experience using weights?

#Person2#: Well, first it is important to go through a good stretch. You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines.
