#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?
#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.
#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.
#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!
#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.
#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.

#Person2#: I think cooks generally work at entry level jobs. They work at different places in the kitchen and follow recipes. In contrast, chefs have special training and understand better which food goes well together, so they can invent new recipes.
#Person1#: I see, a chef is the cook, who has completed a professional course while a cook it's basically any person who cooks food. By the way, how do you become a chef?
#Person2#: I am trained. 95% is about professional training and the other 5% is about talent.
#Person1#: Would you mind describing us a day of a chef? We're so curious about that.
#Person2#: Nothing special, I generally go to work 2 hours before service starts. The night before, I've written the lists of all the things we need to prepare the next day. I work in different roles depending on what is needed.
#Person1#: Challenging. How long do you work everyday?
#Person2#: 10 to 12 hours a day.
#Person1#: An almost full time job! Do you have any tips for average cooks, like me?
#Person2#: Cooking involves your passion and creativity. Kitchen is never a place to chop vegetables, and have a quick breakfast. It is good to make food that people really enjoy.

If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.

#Person1#: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?
#Person2#: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity.

Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest.

train_760,"#Person1#: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?
#Person2#: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.
#Person1#: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?
#Person2#: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.
#Person1#: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?
#Person2#: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.
#Person1#: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?
#Person2#: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.","#Person1# have an interview with Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.

#Person2#: Not a lot really... I should say just over an hour.
#Person1#: So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV?

#Person1#: And what sort of programmes do you go for?
#Person2#: Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows.
#Person1#: Fine. And turning to the new channel..., which type of programmes would you like to see more of?
#Person2#: Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information..., you know, providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for younger viewers..., you know, good quality stuff.
#Person1#: Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them?
#Person2#: I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, you know, the sound system.

#Person1#: Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement. Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan. Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.
#Person2#: That's interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.
#Person1#: That seems a bit unstable don't you think?
#Person2#: Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.

#Person1#: Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course. 
#Person2#: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi? 
#Person1#: No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. 
#Person2#: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right? 
#Person1#: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. 
#Person2#: Sauvignon Blanc? What's that? 
#Person1#: That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay. 
#Person2#: Let's see. The label says it's got 'attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled. ' Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I'm on my way to the dinner now.

#Person2#: All right. What varietal is that? 
#Person1#: Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. 
#Person2#: And you think this is a good wine? 
#Person1#: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma.

#Person1#: No, probably not. For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours.

#Person1#: Yes. I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything. So that you understand the terms.

#Person1#: Absolutely! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface. It's just a matter of how deep it is.
#Person2#: Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to grow simple plants?
#Person1#: The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything. And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation.
#Person2#: Actually, we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time. Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet?
#Person1#: I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, but they have looked at various designs.
#Person2#: One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it. What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory?
#Person1#: Well, I'm not really an expert in this area, but my understanding is that anything is possible. It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4. 5 billion years ago.
#Person2#: But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans.

Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything?

#Person1#: Well, we wouldn't know what there was to buy if we didn't have advertisements.

train_1478,"#Person1#: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?
#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.
#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?
#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.",#Person1# asks about premarital contracting. #Person2# is not surprised that people's initial reaction towards premarital contracting is negative but still thinks it's a way to learn more about each other. #Person3# thinks that premarital contracting is a communication process and it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.,premarital contracting

#Person1#: OK, so tell us about this new toy.
#Person2#: Well. It's similar to a relaxation ball in its function, but it's useful for anyone who has problems focusing.
#Person1#: So how does it work?
#Person2#: It's about the size of a cookie and it has 3 small round parts that can move in any direction. Basically, you just hold it in between your thumb and middle finger and spin it. That's it.
#Person1#: That's it?
#Person2#: Yeah, it's very popular. Not only with children, but with adults as well.
#Person1#: A professor at MIT by the name of Jill Mean Lee has publicly stated there is no scientific or medical evidence for your claims about its benefits. Many schools also have banned the toy, saying it leads to a lack of focus in the classroom.

#Person2#: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family.
#Person1#: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that?
#Person2#: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake.
#Person1#: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years.
#Person2#: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time.
#Person1#: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit?
#Person2#: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities.
#Person1#: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely.
#Person2#: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need.
#Person1#: A hotel sounds nice.
#Person2#: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people.
#Person1#: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease.
#Person2#: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park.
#Person1#: Wow.
#Person2#: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important.
#Person1#: What about money? I have a credit card.
#Person2#: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must.
#Person1#: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated?
#Person2#: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated.
#Person1#: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely.
#Person2#: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful.
#Person1#: Like Matches?
#Person2#: Matches? If You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches.
#Person1#: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions.
#Person2#: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with.
#Person1#: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ...

We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the. . . , which is a but north. And the further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly.

#Person1#: When I do push-ups, should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground? 
#Person2#: You don't need to bend your elbows that much. Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle. The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight. Many people bend their bodies at the waist, which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise.
